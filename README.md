# Uncovering Housing Risks In NYC: Unsupervised Learning for NYC Housing Code Violation

Housing violations in NYC, particularly in Manhattan and Brooklyn, threaten tenant safety and urban livability. The HPD issues violations for unsafe conditions, but identifying high-risk buildings and optimizing enforcement remains challenging due to the volume and complexity of data. Preliminary findings indicate that older buildings in densely populated areas exhibit a higher recurrence of severe violations, making them a priority for targeted regulatory intervention. This project uses geospatial analysis, clustering, association rules and text analysis to provide insights for strengthening enforcement, tenant protection, resource allocation, and policy recommendations, ensuring a more efficient and proactive approach to housing code enforcement in NYC.
Specifically, we aim to: 
1. Identify common violation types and trends across boroughs to detect high-risk regions. 
2. Cluster buildings by violation severity, recurrence, and resolution time to predict high-risk properties and support preventive regulation. 
3. Examine the relationship between housing type, season, apartment position, and violation category to understand systemic patterns and help developers mitigate recurring issues. 
4. Analyze NOV descriptions using topic modeling to uncover recurring themes and enhance regulatory responses for more effective enforcement.
